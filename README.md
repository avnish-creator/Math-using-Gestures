Created an advanced gesture-based math tool using Python,OpenCV, and MediaPipe, integrated with the Gemini API to interpret hand gestures and solve a variety of math problems in real-time.
Introduced an interactive, hands-on experience where users can tackle math questions with intuitive hand gestures,transforming traditional problem-solving into an engaging activity.
Developed a visually engaging and user-friendly interface that displays gestures and solutions instantly, enhancing the learning experience.

🔹 How It Works:
✅ The application tracks hand gestures using Mediapipe Hand Tracking and OpenCV.
✅ Users can draw mathematical expressions (like 12 + 8 ✖️ 3) in the air using finger gestures.
✅ The drawn expression is extracted and processed into a readable mathematical format.
✅ Using Gemini API, the app solves the expression in real time and displays the result.
✅ Built an interactive UI with Streamlit for seamless experience.
🔹 Tech Stack Used:
🔸 OpenCV – for image processing and hand contour detection 📸
🔸 Mediapipe – for real-time hand landmark detection 🤚
🔸 Streamlit – for deploying and running the app as a web-based tool 🌐
🔸 Gemini API – for accurate mathematical calculations after recognizing the drawn expression 🤖

🔹 Use Cases & Applications:
🚀 Interactive Learning Tool – Helps students and educators learn math in a fun and engaging way.
🎮 Touchless Interfaces – Reduces the need for keyboards/mouse and enables gesture-based computing.
🔢 Assistive Tech – Useful for people with physical disabilities who may find traditional input methods challenging.
🖥️ AI-powered Blackboards – Could be extended for gesture-based notetaking and symbol recognition.
This project showcases how computer vision, AI & natural hand gestures can revolutionize the way we interact with technology.
